1) We may have to deal with these dependencies at some point:

ERROR: tensorflow 2.2.0 has requirement scipy==1.4.1; python_version >= "3", but you'll have scipy 1.5.2 which is incompatible.
ERROR: tensorflow-tensorboard 1.5.1 has requirement bleach==1.5.0, but you'll have bleach 3.1.5 which is incompatible.
ERROR: tensorflow-tensorboard 1.5.1 has requirement html5lib==0.9999999, but you'll have html5lib 1.1 which is incompatible.

2) Added the keras.json here, but not sure if this is the right place,
or how this might work on Windows. We'll know more when we try to actually run the NN.
